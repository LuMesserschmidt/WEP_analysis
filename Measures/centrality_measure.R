## The following R code provides
# some illustrative examples of a proposed measure of 'centralization' of government policies
# where 'centralization' is conceptualized as the degree to which the national government has
# sole control over policy making in a country
# By: Cindy Cheng

## The proposed measure accounts for the following issues:
# issue 0: must account for subnational cases
# issue 1:  must account for cases when there is a national level policy that covers all subnational regions
# issue 2 : must account for cases when there is a national level policy that targets some subnational regions
# issue 3: must account for cases over time

# First Proposed Measure: 
# estimate the degree centrality of each respective illustrative network
  # the proposed measure would use network1 as the baseline measure for the highest degree of centralization 
  # and all other networks would be judged relative to this baseline
  # This measure would thus range from 0 to 1, where 0 is no centralization and 1 is full centralization
  # e.g. centr_degree(network1, mode = 'all')$centralization/centr_degree(network1, mode = 'all')$centralization == 1; this would be the 'most centralized' degree of policymaking
  # centr_degree(network5, mode = 'all')$centralization/centr_degree(network1, mode = 'all')$centralization ; this would be relatively 'decentralized' state of policymaking

  # This measure would thus range from 0 to 1, where 0 is no centralization and 1 is full centralization
  # e.g. subgraph_centrality(network1)[1]/subgraph_centrality(network1)[1] == 1; this would be the 'most' centralized' degree of policymaking
